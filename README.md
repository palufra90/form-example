From the latest minimal template example, this codebase contains the implementation of a minimal form, one done in Astro, following the [astro form recipe](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/build-forms/), and another done in react.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   └── pages/
│       ├── index.astro
|       ├── post
|       └── api
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

## 🤌 Purpose

The purpose of this repo, is to understand deeply the difference between implementing the same feature with only astro components, or with a react component and the island feature.

It also contain a minimal example of and endpoint and its use.
